## Phase 1: Initial Data Inspection (The Basics)

# --- Step 1: Loading the data ---

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from itertools import combinations
from collections import Counter
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


Inter_sales_rp = pd.read_csv(r'c:\Users\obasi\Downloads\International sale Report.csv', encoding= 'latin1' )

# --- Step 2: Getting the Dimensions ---
print(f'The dataset has {Inter_sales_rp.shape[0]} rows and {Inter_sales_rp.shape[1]} columns')

# --- Step 3: Inspecting the Data Types and Missing Values ---
print(Inter_sales_rp.info())
